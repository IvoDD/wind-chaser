- Consider data retention policies for old forecasts

### Scraping Strategy
- Start with Windguru only, design for extensibility
- Implement respectful scraping (delays, user agents)
- Handle anti-scraping measures gracefully
- Consider using proxy rotation if needed

### Notification System
- Use cron jobs for periodic checks
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Allow users to set notification frequency
- Track notification delivery status

### Frontend Architecture
- Use React Context for global state management
- Implement component lazy loading
- Use React Query for API state management
- Progressive Web App features (optional)

### Security Best Practices
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling without exposing internals

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Windguru Anti-Scraping
**Solution**: Use proper headers, delays between requests, and consider headless browser if needed

### Challenge: Email Deliverability
**Solution**: Use reputable email service (SendGrid), implement SPF/DKIM records

### Challenge: Scale for Many Users
